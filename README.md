**JSON Parser**
This is a JSON parser as from Coding Challenges. The challenge involves creating a program or function that can convert a JSON string into a corresponding data structure (like a Python dictionary or a JavaScript object). 
This process involves parsing the JSON string, extracting the tokens, and then constructing the data structure based on the parsed tokens. 

**My Implementation**
This implementation is written in java with maven structure.
Original ideas of Lexer and Parser from literature.
This implementation does not fulfill test 18, 25  37 of final tests (see StepFinalTest5,java), because I believe that should be accettable the three test casese, two because wihtespaces are dropped and one because I ha no limit in nesting lists.

Actual eversion: 1.0

**The Challenge**

Build Your Own JSON Parser.

**What's next**
Version 2.0 will implemente AST tree for retrieval and navigation in JSON file.
